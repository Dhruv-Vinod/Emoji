            <h1>😉 Winking Face
            </h1>
            <p>A yellow face with a slight smile shown winking, usually its left eye. May signal a joke, flirtation,
                hidden meaning, or general positivity. Tone varies, including playful, affectionate, suggestive, or
                ironic.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>💩 Pile of Poo</h1>
            <p>A swirl of brown poop, shaped like soft-serve ice cream with large, excited eyes and a big, friendly
                smile.

                May be used to represent feces and other bathroom topics as well as stand in for their many related
                slang terms. It also enjoys a wide range of idiosyncratic applications, such as conveying a sense of
                whimsy or silliness, given its fun, happy expression.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>👍 Thumbs Up</h1>
            <p>A thumbs-up gesture indicating approval.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>👎 Thumbs Down
            </h1>
            <p>A thumbs-down gesture indicating disapproval.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>😡 Pouting Face</h1>
            <p>A red face with an angry expression: frowning mouth with eyes and eyebrows scrunched downward. Bears the
                same expression as 😠 Angry Face on most platforms and may convey more intense degrees of anger, e.g.,
                hate or rage.</p>
